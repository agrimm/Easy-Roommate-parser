== DESCRIPTION:

Parse Easy roommate's data, to make it easier to find relevant entries.

== DISCLAIMER:

* Most web sites don't like unauthorized web scrapers, so don't hammer it with a hundred hits a second!
* The author(s) of this software are in no way affiliated with Easy Roommate, apart from having a profile on there. And not wanting to have that profile taken down because of misbehaviour!

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Nokogiri

== INSTALL:

* Currently not a gem

== CURRENT BUGS:

* Having bugs would imply the script is useful. It isn't at that stage yet.
